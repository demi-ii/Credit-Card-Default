# Credit-Card-Default

ðŸ“Š **Loan Default Risk Analysis**
A data-driven analysis of factors influencing credit card loan defaults


ðŸ”¹ **Project Overview**
This project explores a credit card default dataset to understand the factors that influence whether clients default on their loans.
Using SQL for data wrangling, Tableau for visualization, and PowerPoint for presentation, I analyzed default rates across demographics, payment history, and created a severity risk score.
The goal is to demonstrate skills in:
â€¢	Data cleaning and feature engineering (SQL)
â€¢	Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
â€¢	Risk segmentation & business insights
â€¢	Dashboard storytelling with Tableau
 
ðŸ”¹ **Dataset**
â€¢	Source: Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset (UCI) from Kaggle
â€¢	Records: 30,000 clients
â€¢	Features: Demographics (age, gender, education, marriage), credit history, payment status (PAY_0â€“PAY_6), and default status
 
ðŸ”¹ **Key Questions Answered**
1.	What is the most risky age group ?
2.	Which credit limit ranges have higher default rates?
3.	What demographic groups (gender, education, marital status) show higher risk?
4.	Can past monthly delays (PAY_0â€“PAY_6) be used to anticipate future default?
 
ðŸ”¹ **Methodology**
1.	**SQL Analysis**
o	Cleaned and transformed raw dataset
o	Engineered a severity score: total past payment delays
o	Segmented clients by risk status (Good, Medium, High)
o	Calculated default rates across age groups, education levels, and payment history


2.	**Visualization (Tableau)**
o	Created an interactive dashboard to explore default trends
o	Displayed severity impact on default probability
o	Compared demographic groups side-by-side


3.	**Presentation (PowerPoint)**
o	Summarized insights into a business-friendly deck
o	Highlighted key findings & recommendations
